# üè° Airbnb Clone Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project is a full-stack clone of Airbnb built to simulate the functionality of a real-world booking platform. It includes user login/signup, property browsing, detailed listing views, and a simplified booking flow. The project also emphasizes clean UI/UX and component-based architecture.

## üéØ Project Goals

- Recreate the core features of Airbnb‚Äôs platform.
- Practice full-stack development using modern technologies.
- Implement responsive design and smooth user interactions.
- Emphasize maintainable code and collaborative team workflow.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose)
- **Authentication**: JWT, OAuth (optional)
- **Deployment & DevOps**: GitHub Actions, Render/Vercel
- **Others**: Figma (for UI design), Postman (API testing), ESLint/Prettier (code quality)

### üéØ Importance of a Good Design

A user-friendly design improves engagement, reduces drop-off rates, and ensures users can complete tasks (like booking or viewing listings) efficiently. In booking systems, clarity, speed, and trust (through design) are essential to conversions.

### üìê Importance of Identifying Design Properties

Documenting design properties early:
- Aligns the team on visual consistency.
- Saves time during implementation.
- Makes it easier to adapt mockups into responsive components.
- Allows easier collaboration between designers and developers.

## üß± UI Component Patterns

To maintain a scalable and maintainable UI, we will use reusable components. Here are the main planned components:

- **Navbar**
  - Site branding, search bar, login/logout buttons, responsive menu.
- **Property Card**
  - Used in listing views; includes image, title, price, rating, and quick details.
- **Footer**
  - Contains links to pages like About, Help, Privacy, social icons.

Other components may include:
